                                <p>We offer swimming lessons suitable for all ages and abilities with skilled teachers and small class sizes. The classes we offer are designed to progress from complete beginners to the point where our swimmers feed into competitive clubs. In fact, our swim school is well known by several local competitive clubs for providing high quality swimmers, who have gone onto swim successfully at higher levels.<br />
    <br />
    From Parent and Baby classes through to competitive level training, there is something available for everyone.<br />
    <br />
    Alongside our private lessons, Chichester Swim School also offers a school swimming package, which is currently running successfully at Oakwood Preparatory School. This brings the same high level of tuition which closely follows the National Curriculum Plan, with a detailed administrative plan, report system and staffing.<br />
    <br />
    Our small community feel and personable approach allows all teachers to track the progress of swimmers throughout the stages and build a brilliant relationship with them. This support and encouragement is something we pride ourselves on, and look forward to sharing with new swimmers.<br />

                                <p>We offer “Parent and Baby” and “Parent and Toddler” lessons. These sessions are based around fun and interactive games, building water confidence and basic stroke awareness in an enjoyable, sociable and supportive atmosphere. They also provide information for the parents, allowing them to feel confident that they can help their children learn outside of lessons.<br />
    <br />
    All of the teachers running these sessions hold specialist parent and baby teaching qualifications, with a wealth of knowledge and experience with this age group.</p>

                                <p>Our Pre-School lessons bridge the gap between “Parent and Child” lessons and our “Learn to Swim 4+” lessons. With a maximum of four children per teacher and parents on the side, these small groups allow individual focus throughout the sessions, helping the swimmers to develop in their own timeframe. There is a big focus on water confidence, encouraging our swimmers to enjoy their time in the water. Our Pre-School lessons provide our swimmers with the skills they need to progress rapidly in later stages, while learning to love swimming!</p>

                                <p>Our “Learn to Swim” program is for children of school age and above, working through both the  ASA and STA Learn to Swim schemes. Our beginner lessons are a great way for swimmers to build confidence in the water alongside developing basic swimming technique. Continuing through the stages, our classes prepare children for the many routes learning to swim can lead to, e.g. Water Safety, Competitive Swimming, Lifeguarding etc...<br />
    With small classes of up to five children per teacher, allocated based on similar ability, our sessions encourage efficient development and enjoyable lessons. We assess progress constantly, ensuring that children are placed in the most beneficial group for their ability at any time in the term. Badges are awarded twice a year to celebrate our swimmers’ achievements and encourage progression.</p>

                                <p>Our “Swim Training” sessions are 45 minutes long, helping our more confident swimmers develop endurance and stamina while taking a closer look at technique, with the aim of producing a streamlined and competitive stroke. This is a great pathway into competitive swimming clubs, but also a good option for those who want to keep swimming as a hobby. We offer strong links with local competitive clubs and our teachers all have a background in competitive swimming.</p>
